Telegram Bot for Currency Conversion

This Telegram bot is written in Python and uses the pyTelegramBotAPI library to interact with Telegram and the requests library to get currency rates from the API of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB).

Description
This bot responds to the /start and /help commands, providing the user with information on how to use the bot. The /convert command starts the currency conversion process. The user enters an amount, source currency and target currency separated by a space, and the bot returns the converted amount based on the current exchange rates from the NBRB API.

Note
Don't forget to replace Enter KEY with your actual Telegram API key.
